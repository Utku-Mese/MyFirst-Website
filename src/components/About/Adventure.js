                        I took my first step into the world of software during my final year of high school by learning <b className="purple">HTML</b> and <b className="purple">CSS</b>.
                        I designed some simple, non-interactive websites.
                        Subsequently, I achieved my goal of entering the <b className="purple">Software Engineering </b> department at the university.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        During my first year at university, I learned <b className="purple">Java</b>, thus grasping the concept of <b className="purple">object-oriented programming</b>.
                        I also engaged in numerous activities and exercises to enhance my <b className="purple">algorithmic thinking</b>.
                        I developed various desktop applications with java.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Later, I learned <b className="purple">C#</b>, further advancing my skills in object-oriented programming
                        and delving into database technologies, mastering <b className="purple">SQL</b>, and working on more comprehensive projects and automations.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Following this, my interest shifted towards <b className="purple">cybersecurity</b>, prompting me to install <b className="purple">Kali Linux</b> on my computer.
                        This allowed me to learn about cybersecurity and explore attack, defense, and encryption techniques.
                        Consequently, I gained experience in using Linux and Bash.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Afterward, my interest in cybersecurity evolved into an interest in mobile programming.
                        It was then that <b className="purple">Flutter</b> and <b className="purple">Dart</b> captivated me with their cross-platform capability and developer-friendly features.
                        I honed my skills in developing mobile applications using Flutter, and I created some applications using Flutter and <b className="purple">Firebase</b>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        After about a year, merely using the <b className="purple">APIs</b> provided to me didn't feel sufficient.
                        To comprehensively understand and master all software processes, I delved into research.
                        This led me to explore and learn about back-end technologies. I created my own back-end services using <b className="purple">Node.js</b>, <b className="purple">Express.js</b>, and <b className="purple">MySQL</b>.
                        I also conducted research on topics like the <b className="purple">REST architecture</b>, <b className="purple">HTTP protocol</b>, <b className="purple">MVC</b>, and <b className="purple">MVVM</b> architectures.
                        I can now build my own systems from scratch, encompassing the database, back end, API, and front end.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Simultaneously, as my interest in mobile applications grew, I also learned <b className="purple">Python</b>.
                        Initially, I developed scripts to simplify some tasks using Python.
                        I then enrolled in a <b className="purple">TensorFlow</b> boot camp, into machine learning.
                        Subsequently, I worked on projects related to image processing, scraping data from the internet, and processing it.
                        Python, for me, became an incredibly versatile tool and a funy toy. I still enjoy using Python and resort to it whenever necessary.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I also delved into robotics coding for a while. I bought an <b className="purple">Arduino</b> kit and started researching robotics coding.
                        I gained practical experience by working on projects like park sensors, radar, and smart keys.
                        I still continue to use Arduino to create projects that simplify some of my tasks.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For a brief period, I also dabbled in game development. During this time, I created a simple 2D game using <b className="purple">Unity</b> and C#.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Currently, I am learning <b className="purple">Kotlin</b> and improving my skills in the native Android domain.
                        However, I initially wanted to learn <b className="purple">Swift</b> to enhance my knowledge in iOS development,
                        but I can't do so because I haven't a device with the MacOS operating system.
                        Therefore, I focused on improving my knowledge of Kotlin for native Android development.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Throughout all these processes, through both academic studies and personal research,
                        I have expanded my knowledge in various domains and will continue to do so as long as I breathe.
                        I am well-versed in a of subjects such as <b className="purple">software documentation</b>, <b className="purple">UML diagrams</b>, <b className="purple">requirement analysis</b>, <b className="purple">design patterns</b>,
                        <b className="purple"> algorithm analysis</b>, <b className="purple">database management systems</b>, <b className="purple">algorithms</b>, <b className="purple">software life cycle</b> and project management methodologies like <b className="purple">Agile-Scrum</b>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I have a <b><a className="purple" href="https://youtube.com/@mehmetutkumese?si=VdvtPOXz-b25GaXy" color="#888888" target="blank">YouTube channel</a></b>. I enjoy creating, editing, and sharing videos about the projects I undertake.
                        It makes me happy to help someone learn what I have learned and applied. <b className="purple">I firmly believe that knowledge grows as it is shared</b>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Learning will always be both fun and essential for me. I aspire to share what I learn and contribute to its expansion.
                        Thus, being a part of a team and creating wonderful things through teamwork has always been enjoyable for me.
                        Contributing, even in a small way, to someone's learning journey is gratifying for me.
